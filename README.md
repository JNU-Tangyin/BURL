# BURL
Behavior-aware URL embedding

In the context of the Internet, the representation of URLs have become the core for almost all downstream analysis, including detecting malicious websites, classifying websites, analyzing customer behavior, and content recommendation. To achieve these goals, various techniques have been developed, typically using word embedding techniques to represent URL components as vectors. These methods have enjoyed the success of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. However, neglecting the behavioral patterns among consecutive requests in a session, these methods still face challenges such as interpretability and loss of semantics when dealing with various data-sets. In this study, we propose a general purposed Behavior-aware URL (BURL) embedding approach, which combines contrastive learning with URL embedding and demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method through exploration of various downstream tasks. Additionally, a downstream task is introduced to improve the precision of the recommendation system by accurately identifying active behaviors of apps on a private data sets.
